    content:"Elevation drawings are orthographic elevations, which means they are flat 2d drawings. Orthographic projection according to Merriam Webster is the â€˜projection of a single view of an object (such as a view of the front) onto a drawing surface in which the lines of projection are perpendicular to the drawing surface. This is not to be confused with the concept of 3d elevation. 3d elevation is real-time elevation generation based on cad drafting. As one changes elements in the floor plans, changes reflect in the elevation. Coming back to the elevation definition.",
